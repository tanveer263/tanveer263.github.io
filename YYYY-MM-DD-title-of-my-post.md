5 things abot life
1. Feelings are often real. But the words we use to express them, most of the time, are illusory.
So, carefully think about the words we choose to use.
Never say “I love you” just to create an illusion of feelings, nor to make our counterpart love us. 
The worst of “I love you”s are those that are not wholeheartedly said. 
Therefore, when you say it; make sure you mean it.

2. Being young is not only about leaving a mark in the world. 
It is also about letting the world leaves a mark within us.
May it be through an event, or even more, through a person. 
So go. Fall in love, make mistakes, break your heart, and probably start over.

3. There is no such thing as “unrequited feeling.”
However, perhaps, the level of requital that we get might be higher or lower than our expectations. 
(Perhaps it’s best not to expect anything at all, and let it be a surprise. Let life surprises you.)

4. When God takes away something you (thought you) have, usually you are going to get something better.
However, be grateful of what you have at the moment.
Keep it. Protect it. Or you might end up losing something that matters the most in your life.
(And try not to regret when that happens, especially when you have failed in protecting it.
Let it wander to a better place, a place that would keep it safe.)
 
 
 5. Never fall in love in your sleep
What usually comes as a dream might suddenly show up as a nightmare.
Since then, your sleeps and naps would never be the same anymore.
Be in love while you are awake. 
Be in love knowing the risks you take, the ‘dangers’ you will face.
Be in love with a person, not the idea of him/her that you have projected yourself.
Be in love with a person, not the idea of him/her that he/she tries to project for you to believe in.
