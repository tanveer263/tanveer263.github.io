			<p><em>The day you were born you began a learning process that will continue for the rest of your life.
				<p>You were, from the beginning, molded by your surroundings, parents, relatives, playmates,</p>
				<p>by all the general attitudes, ideas, and beliefs you came in contact with.</p>
				<p>Each new year of life added to your past, changing the way you viewed every new day,</p>
				<p>influencing how you reacted to everything from the simplest daily routines to complex events touching you,
					your family,</p>
				<p>and the world you lived in</em>.</p>
